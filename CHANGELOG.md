# GitHub Issue Template Updates

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the changes made to improve the GitHub Issue Template structure for the Podcast Transcriber.

## What Changed

### Before (Old Structure)
```yaml
- Title (input) - Episode title
- Content (textarea) - Commentary + embedded audio URL in markdown
```

**Example old usage:**
```markdown
Content Field:
This episode covers AI development topics.

Audio URL: [Episode 301](https://example.com/podcast.mp3)
```

### After (New Structure)  
```yaml
- Title (input) - Episode title
- Audio URL (input) - Direct audio file URL
- Content (textarea) - Commentary only (optional)
```

**Example new usage:**
```
Title: Episode 301: AI Development
Audio URL: https://example.com/podcast.mp3
Content: This episode covers AI development topics.
```

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **üéØ Clearer Separation**: URL and content are distinct fields
2. **‚úÖ Better Validation**: URL field can be validated specifically
3. **üìù Simpler Content**: Users don't need to format markdown links
4. **üîß Easier Processing**: No need to parse URLs from text content
5. **üöÄ Better UX**: More intuitive form filling experience

## Files Updated

### 1. GitHub Issue Template
- **File**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/podcast-transcription-request.yml`
- **Changes**: Added dedicated `url` input field, made `content` optional

### 2. Action Processor
- **File**: `github_action_processor.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated `process_github_issue()` to extract URL from dedicated field
  - Removed `extract_audio_urls()` function (no longer needed)
  - Added URL validation logic

### 3. Test Scripts
- **File**: `test_processor.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated test cases to match new issue structure
  - Added URL validation tests
  - Removed URL extraction tests

### 4. Documentation
- **Files**: `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`
- **Changes**: Updated examples and instructions to show new form structure

## Backward Compatibility

‚ùå **Breaking Change**: This update is NOT backward compatible with the old issue template format.

**Migration**: Existing open issues using the old format will need to be manually updated or closed and recreated.

## Testing

All tests pass with the new structure:
- ‚úÖ Issue processing extracts title, URL, and content correctly
- ‚úÖ URL validation works for audio file extensions
- ‚úÖ Transcript creation handles optional content field
- ‚úÖ All syntax validation passes
