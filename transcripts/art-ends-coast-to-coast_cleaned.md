The end of an era

## Transcript

You may recall that about a year ago, I mentioned an event—a threatening, terrible event—that occurred to my family. At the time, I told you I could not discuss it. Because of that event, and a succession of other events, what you’re listening to right now is my final broadcast. This is it, folks. I’m going off the air and will not return.

What I will tell you now is the same thing I told you then: when the time comes, when I can share what happened, I will. I’ll explain everything through the press or some form of media. It’s not that I want to keep anything from my audience. However, for the protection of my family, I cannot and will not discuss it until the time is right. If you were in my position, I believe you would do the same. And when you finally hear the full story—whenever that may be—I think you’ll understand.

I didn’t want to leave without saying something, so I’m telling you now: this is my final broadcast. It’s been a good run. You’ve been a wonderful audience, and this has been an absolutely incredible forum. My hope is that the forum will continue in some form. I believe it will, and I certainly hope it does.

When the time comes and I’m able to release this information, I will. Given the magnitude of this forum and the connection I’ve had with all of you, I trust you’ll get the whole story when the moment arrives. But for now, and for the foreseeable future, this is the end of my broadcast career.

Thank you, and goodbye.
