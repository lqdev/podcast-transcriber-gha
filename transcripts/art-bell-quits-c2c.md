## Transcript

 You may recall about a year ago. I told you that there was an event, a threatening, terrible event that occurred to my family, which I could not tell you about. Because of that event and a succession of other events, what you're listening to right now is my final broadcast on the air. This is it folks, I'm going off the air and we'll not return. And what I will tell you right now is what I told you then, when the time comes, when I can tell you what occurred, I will tell you through the press, through the media of one sort or another, I will explain to you the entire thing, it's not that I want to hold anything back from my audience. However, for the protection of my family, until it is otherwise revealed, I can't discuss it. I won't discuss it. And if you were in my position, you would do exactly the same thing. And when you finally whatever it is, but whatever you hear it, I think you will then understand. At any rate, I wanted to tell you, I didn't want to go without saying a word. So I'm telling you now, what you're listening to is my final broadcast. It's been a good run, and you've been a great audience, and it's been an absolutely incredible forum. And my presumption is that the forum will continue. At any rate, it certainly is my hope that the forum will continue and again, when the time comes, when this information can be released, you can be sure that I will release it and I would assume because of the magnitude of the forum that I have held at that time that you will get the whole story, but the time will come when I'll tell it. So, for now and for the foreseeable future, that's it. That is the end of this man's broadcast career. So, thank you, and goodbye.
